# A Layered Node Example

For more information see the blog post on [edave.net](http://www.edave.net/2011/06/28/layers-layered-architecture-for-nodejs-made-easy

You must have MongoDB up and running for this to work as it attempts to bootstrap some data during startup.

This example relies on a number of modules:

*   [Node 0.4.8](http://nodejs.org)
*   [Express 2.3.11](http://expressjs.org)
*   [mongodb 0.9.4](https://github.com/christkv/node-mongodb-native)
*   [generic-pool 1.0.6](https://github.com/coopernurse/node-pool)
*   [jade@0.12.2](https://github.com/coopernurse/node-pool)
*	[Layers 0.0.3](https://github.com/dave-elkan/layers)
*   [MongoDB 1.6.3](http://mongodb.org/)
